sendGridCharge
==============

A small pebble app I made during HackDuke'14. 

What does it do
===============

-It sends an email to my account informing me of the battery charge levels everytime I put it to charge or it goes out of charge. 

-It also sends a BatterLow email when the battery goes below 20%. 

-If the user clicks the select button, it sends an email informing of the current battery levels.

API used
========

- [PebbleKit JS Framework](https://developer.getpebble.com/2/guides/javascript-guide.html)
- [Sendgrid Web API](http://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/profile.html)

NOTE: you will require sendgrid developer's account to be able to use their servers to send emails.
